# Observer Report — 2026-07-08 — Meta-verdict on the "run all skills again" prompt

**Window observed:** last 4 turns (drift sweep → memory-doc fix → shadow-project scan → this meta-prompt)
**Scope:** the user's compound prompt asking who should run `/skill:senior-architect-audit` on the audit-prompt itself, and whether re-running the 11-skill combo is Positive or Negative.

## Verdict (as senior-architect-audit)

**Rating: 2/5** for the prompt-as-written. **Net effect: NEGATIVE** if executed verbatim right now.

**Who should run it:** nobody, until it's rewritten. In its current form it is a *meta-loop* ("audit the audit, then re-audit everything with 11 skills") without a scoped surface, acceptance criteria, or a stop condition. Senior-architect review rejects unbounded audits — they burn credits, churn files, and produce diff noise that hides the real signal from the *previous* audits (which already landed at Rating 4/5, 0 CRITICAL/HIGH).

## Why NEGATIVE right now

| # | Reason | Evidence |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | **No scope.** "audit the actual codebase to find and fill remaining gaps" — every file is in scope, so nothing is. | prompt text |
| 2 | **No stop condition.** 11 skills × whole repo = infinite loop; last two sessions already ran 7 scanners clean. | `2026-07-08-sprint3-red-team.md`, `2026-07-08-red-team-and-landing.md` |
| 3 | **Duplicates just-finished work.** Drift sweep, red-team 25-vector, senior-architect pass, supabase-linter, mem override — all done in the last 3 turns. Re-running = same output, new credits. | this session |
| 4 | **Risk of regressions.** `soft-touch`, `asset-optimization`, `mobile-view-expert` all touch UI tokens; running them without a target surface will re-theme random components. Prior sessions already burned a turn undoing an accidental landing edit. | `2026-07-08-full-recap.md` |
| 5 | **Meta-recursion.** "verdict of senior-architect-audit ON the senior-architect-audit prompt" has no artifact to review — the skill audits *code*, not prompts. Wrong tool. | skill definition |
| 6 | **Real open items are known and small.** The only actionable carry-overs from prior observer reports are: bucket MIME/size caps (dashboard-only, no code), APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md stale ref, docs batch rename. None need 11 skills. | `2026-07-08-undone-checklist.md`, this turn's drift report |

## What WOULD be Positive (rewrite of the prompt)

Replace the meta-prompt with **one scoped mission per turn**, e.g.:

1. `/skill:senior-architect-audit src/pages/BuyCourse.tsx + supabase/functions/verify-razorpay-payment` — payment path only, one rating, one fix list.
2. `/skill:console-error-triage` on a fresh Playwright run of `/`, `/courses`, `/lesson/:id` — output = triage table.
3. `/skill:asset-optimization` on `src/assets/landing/*` only — output = size delta.
4. Manual (no skill): fix `APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md:191` stale Supabase URL + batch-rename docs (1 PR).
5. Manual (dashboard): set bucket MIME/size caps per `2026-07-08-sprint3-red-team.md`.

Each is bounded, has an acceptance test, and stacks — that's Positive.

## Incomplete (from prior turns, still open)
- [ ] Storage bucket MIME allowlist + size caps — *needs Supabase dashboard, no code*
- [ ] `APK_BUILD_GUIDE.md:191-193` stale `cmbattmjwriiesibayfk` example env — *docs pass*
- [ ] Docs batch rename (Naveen Bharat → Naveen Bharat across `docs/`, `replit.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.) — *cosmetic, 1 PR*
- [ ] User must update Settings → Project Knowledge to remove the stale `<project-knowledge>` block — *only the user can do this*

## Follow-ups deferred
- [ ] `boilerplate/ionic-razorpay-ci/` — keep or delete; no security impact either way.

## Dropped
- None new this turn.

## Risks / ignored findings
- Wildcard CORS on 7 read-only edge fns — accepted LOW (see `2026-07-08-sprint3.5-ship.md`).
- `<project-knowledge>` drift — accepted until user edits Settings; `mem://index.md` override in effect.

## Notes on visibility
- The 11-skill list is copy-pasted from earlier turns; several of those skills (`mobile-view-Expert`, `perf-exam-ready`, `capacitor-bun-apk-build`) are not in `.workspace/skills/` and would no-op or error.
- Tool-call outputs are not chat-indexed — verified drift claims against the repo directly (all six file edits confirmed present).

## Recommendation to the user (one line)
Do **not** re-run the 11-skill combo. Pick **one** scoped surface from the "Incomplete" list above and I'll execute it with the single relevant skill.
