## 3. Kya kaam nahi kar raha / partial (11 ⚠️) — root cause + fix plan

| # | Feature | Kyun ⚠️ (root cause) | Impact | Fix plan | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | LectureListing / ChapterView | Unvirtualized list; 200+ lessons pe scroll jank | Low FPS on big courses only | Wrap with `@tanstack/react-virtual` (variable-height) — ~80 LOC | P2 |
| 24 | Stripe | Not configured (optional path) | None — Razorpay covers | Skip unless int'l payments needed | P3 |
| 36 | Downloads / Community / LessonList | Same — variable-height unvirtualized | Jank on 100+ items | `@tanstack/react-virtual` batch — ~150 LOC total | P2 |
| 42 | Immersive + `visibilitychange` ordering | Two handlers share event; if either throws, second may not run | Very low — both are try/catch safe individually | Wrap both in single dispatcher; add `try/catch` around each subscriber | P3 |
| 45 | APK version guard | Never tested on throwaway tag (user skipped) | Zero — real v1.0.17 tags parse correctly (verified locally) | Skip; guard proven by prior green tags | Done |
| 51 | Community feed | Unvirtualized | Jank on active feed | Same virtualization batch as #36 | P2 |
| 52 | Downloads offline list | Unvirtualized | Jank if 50+ downloads | Same batch | P2 |
| 56 | `PlayerTest.tsx` | Dev leftover in `src/pages/` | Ships to bundle (~4 KB gzip) | Delete file + remove route | P3 |
| 57 | Supabase RLS linter | Pre-existing debt on legacy tables | No new regressions | Address in dedicated cleanup PR; not release-blocking | P2 |
| 58 | 3 orphan edge fns | UI never calls them | Dead code cost only | Either wire in admin panel or delete via `supabase--delete_edge_functions` | P2 |
| 59 | Play auto-publish | `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret missing | Manual upload still works | Add secret only when auto-publish desired | P3 |
| 60 | Sentry `crashShield.recovered` breadcrumb | Not yet emitted | Minor observability gap | Add `addBreadcrumb('crashShield','recovered')` in recovery path | P3 |

## 4. Skill-by-skill quick pass

- **app-crash-shield** — heartbeat + traps active; ChatWidget blob-URL leak fixed; no new OOM vectors.
- **asset-optimization** — audit baseline holds; 3D PNGs, PWA icons, OG image intentionally kept as PNG.
- **capacitor-back-button** — single listener + singleton guard verified; Maestro cold-start test present.
- **capacitor-video-player-master** — rotation-aware, immersive sync intact, watermark rolling.
- **console-error-triage** — forwarder → Sentry active; no new bare `console.error` sites.
- **mobile-view-expert** — Books.tsx header clip fixed; other headers pass 375/390/430 widths.
- **senior-architect-audit** — 4.5/5; zero CRITICAL/HIGH.
- **soft-touch** — haptics on Firecrawl / Backfill / PDF popup / send.
- **supabase-architect-auditor** — 5 recent findings resolved; RLS scoped to `authenticated`; GRANTs verified.
- **red-team-security-audit** — leaked-password ON; keystore rotated; no exposed secrets in bundle.
- **perf-exam-ready** — 3 virtualization gaps (P2) documented; bundle within budget.
- **sentry-triage** — top issues mapped in `2026-07-13-sentry-triage.md`; `lesson_progress` schema-reload fix shipped.
- **capacitor-bun-apk-build** — signed-smoke pipeline ready; new keystore SHA-256 `48:E1:05:…:67:80`.

## 5. Fix Plan (prioritized)

**Now (release v1.0.17):** kuch nahi — ship.

**Next sprint (P2, ~250 LOC):**
1. Virtualize Downloads + Community + LessonList + LectureListing + ChapterView (single `@tanstack/react-virtual` batch).
2. Delete `PlayerTest.tsx` + route.
3. Decide: wire OR delete 3 orphan edge functions.
4. Supabase linter cleanup PR (pre-existing debt).

**Backlog (P3):**
5. Stripe config (only if int'l).
6. Play auto-publish secret.
7. `crashShield.recovered` breadcrumb.
8. Single-dispatcher wrapper for `visibilitychange`.

---

## 6. Non-blockers explicitly accepted

- `CACHE_MAX=32` in `useLessonNotes` — 33rd lesson evicts earliest.
- Immersive + presence ordering — both wrapped individually.
- APK test-tag skipped — real tag guard verified prior release.

Used the senior-architect-audit skill.
