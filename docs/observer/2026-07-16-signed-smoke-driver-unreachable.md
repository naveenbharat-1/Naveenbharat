# Signed APK Smoke — `android-driver-unreachable` on v1.0.29 (API 33)

**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Failing run:** `signed-apk-smoke` / API 33 · Maestro 1.39.0 · tag `v1.0.29`  
**Telemetry:** `failure_class=android-driver-unreachable`, `smoke_exit=1`, both attempts failed, `smoke_duration_s=295`, `crash_lines=0`, `boot_ms=4324`.

## User-reported symptom (misleading)

Log snippet contained:

```
daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037
* daemon started successfully
adb: device offline
The process '/usr/local/lib/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb' failed with exit code 1
/usr/local/lib/android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s emulator-5554 shell getprop sys.boot_completed
adb: device offline
```

This is `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner` polling `sys.boot_completed` while ADB is still doing the initial TCP handshake. It retries automatically. Right after these lines the same log shows `Performing Streamed Install → Success`, `App launch sanity check passed`, and `Emulator warm-up complete` — **the emulator, install and app boot are all healthy**. This is not the failure.

## Actual failure

Logcat pinpoints the exact moment (attempt 1, 15:26:30.659):

```
07-15 15:26:30.659   362   362 W SurfaceFlinger: FB is protected: PERMISSION_DENIED
07-15 15:26:30.661  8079  8112 E SerializingExecutor: Exception while executing runnable ...
07-15 15:26:30.661  8079  8112 E SerializingExecutor: java.lang.NullPointerException:
  Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean android.graphics.Bitmap.compress(...)'
  on a null object reference
  at dev.mobile.maestro.Service.screenshot(MaestroDriverService.kt:311)
  at maestro_android.MaestroDriverGrpc$MethodHandlers.invoke(MaestroDriverGrpc.java:809)
```

The screenshot NPE repeats **17 times** across both attempts. Every subsequent Maestro gRPC call fails with `io.grpc.stub.ClientCalls.toStatusRuntimeException(...)` — the driver channel is dead.

## Root cause

Three-part chain:

1. Landing page (Index.tsx / Hero.tsx marketing copy) lives inside the Capacitor WebView. The Android accessibility tree only exposes an empty root:  
   `packageName: com.safarenglishka.app; className: android.view.View; viewIdResName: root; text: ""`.
2. Maestro's text matcher (`Angreji bolne|safar shuru|Welcome Back|Login|…`) finds nothing in the accessibility tree, so it falls back to a screenshot-based OCR / idle-detection path.
3. On the API 33 `google_apis` emulator image, `UiAutomation.takeScreenshot()` returns a null `Bitmap` (SurfaceFlinger denies framebuffer access to non-system UID). The Maestro driver has no null-check → NPE → SerializingExecutor kills the gRPC handler → driver marked unreachable.

Root cause classification: **WebView-DOM/a11y gap + emulator SurfaceFlinger permission**, not app bug, not signing, not network, not "adb offline".

## Fix applied

### `maestro/smoke.yaml`
Re-enable `androidWebViewHierarchy: devtools`. This tells Maestro to traverse the Chromium DOM through the DevTools socket (port 9222), which is already open on signed release builds because `CAP_DEBUG=1` is set in `signed-apk-smoke.yml:171`. With DOM traversal:
- Text tokens are found directly in HTML — no OCR fallback.
- Screenshot codepath is no longer the hot path.
- The 2026-07 API 28/35 hang risk is scoped away: those legs are advisory (`continue-on-error: true`, workflow_dispatch-only via `run_advisory_legs`). The hard gate is API 33 only.

### `.github/workflows/signed-apk-smoke.yml`
1. Emulator boot options gain `-writable-system -selinux permissive`. Belt-and-suspenders: if Maestro ever does hit `screenshot()` on this image, the emulator will now grant framebuffer access instead of returning null.
2. Failure classifier detects the specific SurfaceFlinger pattern:
   ```
   grep -qE "FB is protected: PERMISSION_DENIED|Service\.screenshot\(MaestroDriverService" logcat.txt
   ```
   → `failure_class=driver-screenshot-null`. Distinct from generic `android-driver-unreachable`, so telemetry immediately points at a regression of either of the two fixes above.

## What was NOT changed and why

- **APK signing / gradle**: build succeeded (`Streamed Install: Success`, correct SHA). Untouched.
- **`plan-smoke-matrix`, advisory legs, warm-up, retry loop**: all working as designed on the healthy attempts. Untouched.
- **`src/lib/native/security.ts` (FLAG_SECURE)**: `useScreenProtection` is only mounted on `Library`, `Books`, `Materials`, `Downloads`, `LessonView`, `ArchiveBookReader`. The smoke flow fails on the **landing page**, before any of those mount. Not implicated.
- **`smoke.yaml` selector list**: still valid. Once DOM traversal is in effect the same regex matches even better (matches HTML text nodes, not just accessible-label overrides).

## Verification plan

1. Push throwaway tag `v1.0.30-smoke-devtools`.
2. Watch `smoke-signed-apk / smoke (API 33 · maestro 1.39.0)`.
3. Green criteria: `attempts_used=1`, `smoke_exit=0`, `failure_class=pass`, `crash_lines=0`, no `FB is protected` lines in logcat, `smoke_duration_s < 180`.
4. If it flakes: check telemetry `failure_class`. `driver-screenshot-null` → devtools mode isn't reaching DevTools (check `CAP_DEBUG=1` still in build env). `app-assertion-failed` → token list needs update to match current landing copy.

## Follow-ups (backlog, not blockers)

- **Add a lightweight web landing sentinel** — expose one accessible token (e.g. `role="banner" aria-label="Naveen Bharat"`) so even without DevTools mode Maestro can find the landing page. Cheap insurance against the DevTools socket dying between Chromium versions.
- **Promote API 28 / API 35 to hard-gate** only after ≥5 consecutive greens with devtools mode active. Their old failure mode (devtools discovery hang) may be gone now that emulators are Ubuntu KVM + no snapshot, but no data yet.
- **Upstream** the SurfaceFlinger-null NPE to Maestro (`dev.mobile.maestro.Service.screenshot` should null-check `Bitmap` before `.compress`). Low priority — our `-writable-system` workaround prevents the null in the first place.
