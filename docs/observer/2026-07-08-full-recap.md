## Findings — Senior architect + Supabase auditor lens

### CRITICAL
- **None.** Scanner clean (`supabase`, `supabase_lov`, `agent_security`, `supply_chain` all 0 findings).

### HIGH
- **None active.** All 8 requested internal_ids resolved and marked via `manage_security_finding`.

### MEDIUM
- **[SEC] GraphQL discoverability** — ~95 tables visible to `anon`/`authenticated` via `pg_graphql`. RLS still blocks rows, but schema names leak intent. Fix: `REVOKE SELECT ... FROM anon` on tables with zero anon policies (needs eyeball — courses/hero_banners/subscription_plans are intentionally public). *Deferred, tracked in AUDIT-2026-07-08.md.*
- **[CONFIG] Auth OTP expiry & leaked-password protection** — dashboard toggle, not code. *Needs user action in Supabase → Auth → Providers.*
- **[MAINT] Two migration paths** — root `supabase/migrations/` (live, 20 files) and `safarenglishka/supabase/migrations/` (mirror). Risk of drift; the root is authoritative per past scanner runs. *Recommend: gitignore or explicitly document mirror.*

### LOW
- **[OBS] Observer index missing** — `docs/observer/INDEX.md` did not exist; created below.
- **[MAINT] `docs/AUDIT-2026-07-08.md` fix block has SQL syntax error** — the `EXECUTE format(...) FROM pg_proc ...` block is not valid PL/pgSQL; the fallback DO block below it is the one that actually runs. Cosmetic — the real revoke migration is `20260708094124_*.sql`.
- **[MAINT] Old GRANT still present** — migration `20260601130733_*.sql` re-granted `get_platform_stats` to `anon`; latest migration reverses it. Timeline is fine, but a squash pass would reduce reviewer confusion.

---

## Incomplete
- [ ] **Soft-touch Wave A** — plan finalized, 0 files touched — evidence: last user message "/skill:soft-touch Soft-touch — Wave A only" is scoping-only, no apply command issued.
- [ ] **Advisory linter WARNs** (~110) — surfaced in AUDIT doc, not scheduled.

## Follow-ups deferred
- [ ] **Wave B (Downloads / LessonView / Books)** — blocker: user wants usage-driven order after Wave A ships.
- [ ] **Wave C (Admin + settings)** — blocker: same.
- [ ] **Dashboard toggles** (OTP expiry, leaked-password) — blocker: manual step, not code.

## Linked to current work
- Current soft-touch plan ↔ `src/lib/native/haptics` wrapper — must be the only haptic entry point (Wave A rule).
- `platform-stats` edge fn ↔ `usePlatformStats` hook — landing page anon path now depends on edge fn cold-start; watch p95.

## Dropped
- None this session.

## Risks / ignored findings
- **book-covers / content / notices buckets stay public** — accepted: needed for CDN thumbnails and OG images; RLS on inserts still enforced.
- **Authenticated SECURITY DEFINER RPCs retained** (`has_role`, `get_user_role`, `get_quiz_questions`, `match_knowledge`, `increment_book_clicks`, `get_user_profiles_admin`, `verify_enrollment_for_attendance`) — accepted: each authorizes the caller and sets `search_path = public`.

## Signal-only
- Scanner timestamps say `up_to_date: false` for 4 of 6 scanners — a re-scan on next turn will confirm cleanliness; findings list is already empty.
- 40+ edge functions deployed; no per-function auth audit in this session — out of scope for the 8-finding fix set.

## Notes on visibility
- Tool activity (migrations, edge fn deploys, security marks) is **not** in the chat search index. Cross-checked via repo: migrations `20260708*.sql` present, `_shared/sanitize.ts` present, `platform-stats/index.ts` present, `usePlatformStats.ts` updated.

---

## Fix plan (nothing to apply now)

1. **CRITICAL/HIGH:** none.
2. **MEDIUM:** schedule GraphQL anon-revoke pass; enable OTP + leaked-password in dashboard.
3. **LOW:** ship Wave A when user says "go"; add `.gitignore` for the `safarenglishka/` mirror or document its purpose.

Rating: **4/5** — solid, production-ready security posture; polish work (soft-touch waves + advisory WARNs) is the only backlog.

Used the history-observer, senior-architect-audit, and supabase-architect-auditor skills.
