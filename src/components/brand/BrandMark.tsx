/**
 * BrandMark — real NB logo served from /brand/nb-mark.webp (~7KB webp).
 * The asset is bundled into the app shell (Capacitor ships it as a local
 * file under the WebView origin), so the network cost is effectively zero
 * while keeping the JS initial-entry chunk lean — the previous inline
 * data URL added ~6–7KB of base64 to every cold start.
