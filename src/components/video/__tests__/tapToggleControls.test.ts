/**
 * Soft-touch tap-to-toggle wiring contract for the video players.
 *
 * Scope: source-level invariants only. We deliberately do NOT mount the
 * 1500-line player component — its YouTube IFrame API + Capacitor calls
 * blow up under jsdom. Instead, we assert the wiring is present in source
 * so that future refactors can't silently delete the feature.
 *
 * Players under test:
 *  - MahimaGhostPlayer  (YouTube — primary player, used by UnifiedVideoPlayer)
 *  - MahimaVideoPlayer  (HLS / direct video)
 *
 * UnifiedVideoPlayer delegates YouTube to MahimaGhostPlayer, so testing the
 * Ghost player covers the unified flow.
