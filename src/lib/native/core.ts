/**
 * Single memoized loader for `@capacitor/core` (`Capacitor` + `CapacitorHttp`).
 *
 * Mirrors the `app.ts` / `preferences.ts` pattern. `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`
 * is called on nearly every cold boot; keeping one shared Promise avoids
 * duplicate Vite chunk hydration cost.
 *
 * The `Capacitor` namespace object is safe to resolve directly (it exposes
 * static methods, not a plugin proxy), but we still wrap it for symmetry and
 * to keep a single `.then`-probe-free container shape across the bridge.
