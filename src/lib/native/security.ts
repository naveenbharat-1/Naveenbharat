/**
 * Device-integrity check. Warns (does not block) when running on a rooted
 * Android device or jailbroken iOS device.
 *
 * We intentionally do NOT hard-block:
 *  - Premium video is already protected by short-lived signed Bunny tokens.
 *  - Hard blocks frustrate legitimate power users on rooted dev devices.
 *
 * Detection is best-effort using @capacitor/device + common indicators.
 * For stronger guarantees, swap in @capgo/capacitor-is-root or Play Integrity.
 *
 * OBS: `isVirtual` (emulator) is tracked separately from real root indicators.
 * Emulators are expected in CI (Maestro API 26/30/34) and on developer
 * machines — reporting them as Sentry exceptions burned quota on every green
 * CI run. Now: emulator-only → single breadcrumb, no exception, no toast.
 * Real root indicator → reportError + toast, as before.
